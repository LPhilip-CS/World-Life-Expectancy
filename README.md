# World Life Expectancy
Welcome to the World Life Expectancy Project! This initiative aims to analyze global life expectancy data to uncover insights into health trends and disparities across countries. 

Below is a brief overview to help you navigate through the project:

## Project Objective:
- Understand the factors influencing life expectancy worldwide.
- Identify patterns, correlations, and outliers in life expectancy data.
- Provide valuable insights for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers.

## Dataset:
- The dataset includes life expectancy data for various countries.
- Key variables include Status, GDP, Adult and Infant mortality rates, and more.
- Access the dataset through the 'WorldLifeExpectancy.csv' file or the 'DatabaseScript.sql' file.

## Project Structure:
Data Cleaning:
- Find the data cleaning script in the 'DataCleaning.sql' file.
- Addresses missing values, and outliers, and standardizes formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Discover trends and relationships between attributes. 
- Table visualizations and general statistical analyses are provided.

## Answering Questions:
- Which countries have done well in increasing their life expectancy?
- Is there a drastic change in life expectancy (2007-2022) in the world?
- Is there a correlation between life expectancy and a high or low GDP (Status, BMI) in each country?
- What is the adult mortality rate in the U.S. over the years?

## Getting Started:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Import the dataset from the WorldLifeExpectancy.csv or run 'DatabaseScript.sql' to manually populate the database.
- Run the files in sequential order: DatabaseScript, DataCleaning, and ExploratoryAnalysis.

## Feedback and Support:
- Share your feedback, suggestions, or report issues.
- Thank you for contributing to the World Life Expectancy Project! Together, we can unravel valuable insights for a healthier global future.
