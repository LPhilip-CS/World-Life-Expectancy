# World Life Expectancy
Welcome to the World Life Expectancy Project! This initiative aims to analyze global life expectancy data to uncover insights into health trends and disparities across countries. 

Below is a brief overview to help you navigate through the project:

## Project Objective:
- Understand the factors influencing life expectancy worldwide.
- Identify patterns, correlations, and outliers in life expectancy data.
- Provide valuable insights for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers.

## Dataset:
- The dataset includes life expectancy data for various countries.
- Key variables include Status, GDP, BMI, mortality rates, and more.
- Access the dataset through the folder 'WorldLifeExpectancy.xlsx' file or the 'DatabaseScript.sql' file.

## Project Structure:
Data Cleaning:
- Find the data cleaning script in the 'DataCleaning.sql' file.
- Addresses missing values, and outliers, and standardizes formats.
- Ensure data integrity and format consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Discover trends and relationships between attributes. 
- Table visualizations and general statistical analyses are provided in Excel.

## Answering Questions:
- Which top 5 countries have the highest average life expectancy?
- Is there a drastic change in life expectancy (2007-2022) in the world?
- Is there a correlation between life expectancy and the status (developed vs. developing) of a country?
- What are the overall mortality rates among the age ranges in the United States?

## Getting Started with SQL:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Import the dataset from the WorldLifeExpectancy.csv or run 'DatabaseScript.sql' to manually populate the database.
- Run the files in sequential order: DatabaseScript, DataCleaning, and ExploratoryAnalysis.

## Visualizations in Excel:
- Explore the 'WorldLifeExpectancy.xlsx' file for interactive charts and graphs.
- Leverage Excel functions and tools for further analysis.
- Communicate findings effectively through visual representation and come up with insights and conclusions.

## Feedback and Support:
- Share your feedback, suggestions, or report issues.
- Thank you for contributing to the World Life Expectancy Project! Together, we can unravel valuable insights for a healthier global future.
